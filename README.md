[Unlimitlist](https://unlimitlist.herokuapp.com/#/) is Workflowy clone, an app that aims to give organization to to your ideas. 

## Why Unlimitlist? 

Unlimitlist provides the ability to make and edit lists, mark items as complete, and provides organization of ideas via sublists. Any bulletted idea can house another list. 

## Key Features

* Unlimitlist allows for list items to be created from the interface (button) or with the keyboard, with a press of the enter key for seamless jotting. Items will be created with preservation of list order - with the next item being inserted after the item previously in focus. 

* Bullet items can be added as nested lists underneath bulletted items. This means that lists can be flowing, and organized. 


## Future Features

* Toggling hide/show of completed list items.
* Sharing lists with other users. 
* Drag and drop ordering of list items. 
* Exporting of lists in a printable format.
